<h1 style="color:white;">ROCKET LEAGUE</h1><br>
<h3 style="color:white;">Background Information</h3>
<p style="color:white;">Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015.<br> Ports for Xbox One, OS X, and Linux were released in 2016, and a port for Nintendo Switch is expected in late 2017. 505 Games began distributing a physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016.<br>
Described as soccer, but with rocket-powered cars, Rocket League has one to four players assigned to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course<br> of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes which can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows versions, as well as cross-play between Xbox One, Switch, and Windows versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.
Rocket League was critically praised, earning a number of industry awards, and saw more than six million sales and at least 18 million unique players a year after its release. Rocket League has also been adopted as an eSport, with professional players participating through ESL and Major League Gaming, along with Psyonix hosting their own competitions through the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS).
Matches are typically five minutes long, with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that point. Matches can be played from between one-on-one up to four-on-four players, as well as casual and ranked. Rocket League also includes a competitive ranked online mode, where players compete in various tiered ranks within game seasons, with victories or losses raising or lowering a player's rank, respectively. The game includes a single-player season mode, with the player competing with computer-controlled players. An update in December 2016 introduced Custom Training sequences that can be created by players and shared with others on the same platform; players are able to specify the ball's path and the presence and skill of opponents on the field as to practice specific shots-on-goal over and over.</p><br>

<h3 style="color:white;">Other Features</h3>
<p style="color:white;">Many players can train in free play, use the online workshop, or use tutorial. Players can also design their own types of cars, pick their banners, trade crates, buy crates to unlock cool features that could be put on their car. Players can also check their stats, the leaderboard in competitive, and watch saved replays.</p><br>

<h3 style="color:white;">Types of Matches</h3>
<p style="color:white;">There are two main types of matches: casual and competitive. Casual is where a person gets matched with other people and the ranks do not matter. There is a Solo Duel mode (1v1), Doubles mode (2v2), Standard mode (3v3), Solo Standard mode (3v3) but you have to solo queue and are put on random teams with other players, a basketball mode (Hoops), a hockey mode (Snow Day), Chaos mode (4v4), rumble mode, where there are special items players recieve, and a dropshot mode. Competitive is where players are put against people with the similar skill level as them. Each player plays ten placement matches for Solo Duel, Doubles, Solo Standard, and Standard, to find out there ranks, which are listed below. As you can see, unranked is at the bottom, then followed by bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, champion, and then grand champion at the top. Within each rank (besides unranked and grand champion), there are three subdivisions with four division within each subdivision. You can also play private matches against other players with a specific username and password to keep it private. There is also a season set up to play against bots.</p><br>
