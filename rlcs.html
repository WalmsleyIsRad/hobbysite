<h3 style="color:white;">Background Information</h3>
<p style="color:white;">RLCS, otherwise known as the Rocket League Champion Series, is a professional league established to decide the best rocket league team. For the first three season, teams played through a long qualification to make top eight. The Rocket League Rival Series (RLRS) was introduced this fourth season where the top nine to sixteen teams play in a different league. The top two of the RLRS and bottom two of the RLCS play off in a double elimination bracket to determine who will be in each league next season. The top six teams of the North American and European region qualify for the LAN playoff, top two automatically qualify for LAN. The top four teams of the Oceanic Region play off in a double elimination bracket to determine the top two teams going to LAN. LAN is a place held at the end of every season where teams meet up from each region to play off in a double elimination bracket to determine the world champion. In Season 1, the winner was iBuyPowerCosmic (Kronovi, Lachinio, Gambit, Over Zero). In Season 2, the winner was FlipSid3 Tactics (Markydooda, gReasymeister, kuxir97, JHZER). The Season 3 winner was Northern Gaming (remkoe, Maestro, Deevo, Turbopolsa). Who will Season 4? Watch at <u><a href="http://twitch.tv/rocketleague">RL Twitch</a></u></p><br>
